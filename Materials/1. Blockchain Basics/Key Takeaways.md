#Blockchain Basic - Key Takeways:

## Week One: Defining a Blockchain
- The blockchain technology supports methods for
  - a decentralized peer-to-peer network
  - a collective trust model among unknown peers
  - a distributed immutable ledger of records of transactions.
- Decentralization means the network operates on a user-to-user (or peer-to-peer) basis. 
- A Distributed Immutable Ledger means the data doesn't sit on one all-powerful server and the data stored in it cannot be deleted or edited 
- Transactions bring about transfer of value in Bitcoin Blockchain. The concept UTXO defines the inputs and outputs of such a transaction. 
- Once a block is verified and algorithmically agreed by the miners, it is added to the chain of blocks, viz., the blockchain. 
- An Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) can be spent as an input in a new transaction. 
- The main operations in a blockchain are transaction validation and block creation with the consensus of the participants. Yet, there are many underlying implicit operations, as well. 
- A Smart Contract provides the very powerful capability of “code execution” for embedding business logic on a Blockchain. 
- Significant innovations such as smart contracts have opened up broader applications for blockchain technology. Private and permissioned- blockchains allow for controlled access to the blockchain, enabling many diverse business models. 
- In a Private Blockchain, access to the Blockchain is limited to selected participants. 
- Permissioned or Consortium Blockchain has the benefits of a public blockchain with allowing only users with “permission” to collaborate and transact.

## Week Two: Ethereum Blockchain
- Smart contracts add a layer of logic and computation to the trust infrastructure supported by the blockchain.
- Smart contracts allow for execution of code, enhancing the basic value transfer capability of the Bitcoin Blockchain.
- Solidity is the high level programming language code for writing smart contracts that run on EVM.
- Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a special structure where code is deployed on after being translated into byte-code. 
- Accounts are basic units of Ethereum protocol: external owned accounts and smart contract accounts.
- An Ethereum transaction includes not only fields for transfer of Ethers but also for messages for invoking smart contract.
- Externally Owned Accounts, or EOA, are controlled by private keys.
- Contract Accounts, or CA, are controlled by code and can be activated only by an EOA.
- An Ethereum block contains the usual prev block hash, nonce, transaction details, but also details about gas (fee) limits, the state of the smart contracts and runner-up headers.
- Transaction Validation involves checking the timestamp and nonce combination to be valid, and the availability of sufficient fees for execution.
- Miner Nodes in the network receive, verify, gather and execute transactions.
- Any transaction in Ethereum, including transfer of Ethers, requires fees or gas points to be specified in the transaction.
- Gas Points are used to specify the fees instead of Ether for ease of comparison using standard values.
- Miners are paid fees for security, validation, execution of smart contract as well as for creation of blocks.

## Week Three: Algorithms and Techniques
- Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) family of algorithms is used in Bitcoin as well as Ethereum Blockchain for generating the key pair.
- Rivest-Shamir-Adelman (RSA) is a commonly used implementation of public-private key in many applications, except Blockchains because of its need for a more efficient and stronger algorithm.
- Hashing transforms and maps an arbitrary length of input data value to a unique fixed length value.
- The following are two basic requirements of a hash function. 
- make certain that one cannot derive the original items hashed from the hash value.
- make sure that the hash value uniquely represents the original items hashed.
- A combination of hashing and encryption are used for securing the various elements of the blockchain. Private-public key pair and hashing are important foundation concepts in decentralized networks that operate beyond the trust boundary.
- Asymmetric cryptography uses public-private key pairs to encrypt and decrypt data.

## Week Four: Essentials of Trust
- A Merkle tree is constructed by hashing paired data (the leaves), then pairing and hashing the results until a single hash remains 
- Proof of work is a protocol that has the main goal of deterring cyber-attacks such as a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) which has the purpose of exhausting the resources of a computer system by sending multiple fake requests. 
- Well-defined processes for handling exceptions improve trust in the blockchain. 
- Forks are mechanisms that add to the robustness of the Blockchain framework. 
- Well-managed forks help build credibility in the blockchain by providing approaches to manage unexpected faults and planned improvements. 
- Soft fork and hard fork in the Blockchain world is like the release of software patches and new versions of operating systems respectively. 
- A Soft Fork is a fork where updated versions of the protocol are backwards compatible with previous versions. 
- A Hard Fork is a change of the protocol that is not backwards compatible with older versions of the client. Participants would absolutely need to upgrade their software in order to recognize new blocks. 
- Ommer Blocks contribute to the security of the main chain, but are not considered the canonical "truth" for that particular chain height
